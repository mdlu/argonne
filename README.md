# XANES Analysis of Lithium Transitional Metal Oxides with Neural Networks
Code written under the supervision of Maria Chan and Liang Li. <br />
Purpose is to use x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) from x-ray absorption spectroscopy of lithium transitional metal oxides to make predictions about Fe coordination numbers and charges, which is then used to help analyze the structures' effectiveness as a battery material. <br />
Includes helper code based on Andrew Ng's deep learning courses. <br />
Full documentation and analysis can be found in the 'Documentation and Work Writeup' document and the slides folder. <br />
